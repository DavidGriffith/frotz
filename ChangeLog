Summary of changes between Unix Frotz 2.32R2 and Unix Frotz 2.40:
=================================================================


Unix Frotz 2.40 was released on Saturday November 11, 2000.

BUG FIXES

- Tab-completion now works in the middle of a sentence.

- Assorted fixes to make gcc stop complaining when using -Wall and -ansi
  flags.  These fixes included adding curly braces to avoid
  ambiguous-looking if-then-elses, adding parens to avoid abiguous-looking
  ands and ors, initializing variables even though there was no need to.

- Several functions in ux_text.c used functions that wanted
  *char.  Instead they were being passed *zchar.  Irix's cc
  complained.  Casts were added to fix this.

- The terminal erase character, as set with stty, now functions as
  backspace.  On many terminals, this character is DEL.

- Background colors should now work properly.

- timeout() from curses is now used for times input instead of a busy
  loop.

- ^L and ^R now redraw the screen instead of being passed as input to the
  Z-machine.

- ISO-Latin-1 characters are now valid input unless in plain ASCII mode.
  This makes the meta bit unusable for hotkeys.  On terminals with 8-bit
  character sets, alt usually sends ESC anyway.

- With zstrict error-checking tuning, the -i (for ignore errors) is
  superfluous and therefore has been removed.

- A supplementary memmove() function has been added for machines that lack
  it.  As I don't have access to a machine like this, the code is
  untested.


NEW FEATURES

- Merged changed from Frotz 2.40 for DOS.

- Beginning with 2.40, the reference version of Frotz (the DOS version) is
 distributed under the GNU Public License rather than the old "no
 commercial profit" license.

- Unix Frotz 2.40, like the reference version, is now distributed under
  the GNU Public License.

- V6 games supported by drawing the outlines of pictures.  True display of
  the graphics are on hold until the X11 with GTK version is complete.

- Classical Infocom sound effects supported through the OSS drivers.  I'm
  only aware of "Lurking Horror" and "Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown
  Jewels" as having such sound effects.  See the INSTALL file for
  information on where the sound files should go.

- System-wide and per-user config files.

- Quetzal save format is now the default.  Old Zip 2.0 format is still
  supported by command line option or config file setting.

- $ZCODE_PATH and $INFOCOM_PATH environmental variables searched for game
  files.

- Faster undo functionality (borrowed from Nitfol).

- History searchs has been added.  Type the beginning of a past command
  and hit the up or down arrow key.
