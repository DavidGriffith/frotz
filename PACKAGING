I heartily encourage people to create packages to make it easier for less
computer-savvy people to use Frotz.  However, I do have a few rules on
this.

1.  Email me if you wish to put Unix Frotz into something like a .deb,
    .rpm, Slackware package, the NetBSD pkgsrc tree, FreeBSD's ports
    tree, or anything like that.  When you do so I can note that on the
    Unix Frotz webpage at http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz.

2.  DO NOT have auto-install programs or scripts grab files from that
    page.  The Interactive Fiction Archive at http://www.ifarchive.org
    has mirrors around the world for that sort of thing.

3.  If you distribute a patched version, SEND ME THE PATCHES.  If you
    don't tell me what bugs you've found and fixed, I can't very well fix
    those bugs in the main codebase for all the other users of Frotz.
    Patches that simply change around options in the Makefile obviously
    don't apply.
