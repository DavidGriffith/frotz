============
Packaging ||
============
Please email me if you wish to put Unix Frotz into something
like a .deb, .rpm, Slackware package, the NetBSD pkgsrc tree, FreeBSD's
ports tree, or anything like that so I can note that on the Unix Frotz
webpage at http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi.  _PLEASE_ don't try to do
anything like have auto-install scripts grab files from that page.  Use
ftp.gmd.de or one of its mirrors for that.


====================
Maintainer switch ||
====================
A few months after I submitted my superpatch against Galen Hazelwood's
Unix port of Frotz 2.32, I started playing around again with Unix Frotz to
start adding new features.  I emailed Galen asking if he would be putting
out a new release of Unix Frotz any time soon because I had some nifty new
features to add.  He replied with "no" and asked if I was volunteering to
take over the port.


====================
The switch to GPL ||
====================
Beginning with version 2.40, Frotz is now licensed under the GNU Public
License.  This change came about from an email conversation with Stefan
Jokisch in late May 2000.  I asked if he was still developing the core
code and asked if he'd consider changing the license to GPL or
BSD-like.  He replied by introducing me to Jim Dunleavy to whom he handed
off development of the Frotz core code.  At that time, he decided to
change the license to GPL starting with the one Jim was working on.  Jim
and I then swapped patches back and forth to do some more work on the core
code and so now we have Frotz 2.40.
